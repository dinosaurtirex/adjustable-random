# More adjustable random functions

Generating adjustable random values,
from min to max with numbers to adjust.

For example, we have values from 1 to 10.

If number 2 and 3 will be in numbers to adjust with k=5,
final array will look like this:

```
[1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

and chance of random.choice for those values
will be increased
